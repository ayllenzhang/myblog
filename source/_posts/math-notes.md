Here I'd like to take some time for my math notebook so that I wouldn't learn and forget definitions or theorems again and again :laughing:.

## Lipschitz continuous

Given two metric space $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, dY)$. Given function $f:X\rightarrow Y$, if there exist a real constant $K\geq 0$ such that for all $x_1, x_2$ in $X$,
$$
d_Y(f(x_1)f(x_2))\leq Kd_X(x_1,x_2)
$$
Then $f$ is called Lipschitz continuous.

In particular, for real valued function $f: \R\rightarrow\R$ is called Lipschitz continuous if
$$
|f(x_1)-f(x_2)|\leq K|x_1-x_2|
$$
Apparently, Lipschitz continuous is stricter than uniform continuity.
